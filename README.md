# Email-Filtering-System-using-Machine-Learning
This project involves building a machine learning model to classify emails as spam or not spam. The model can be trained on a dataset of emails and uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract features. The project can be extended to build a fully-functional email filtering system that can categorize incoming emails automatically.
